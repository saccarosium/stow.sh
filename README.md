# Stow.sh

This is a rewrite of the popular GNU stow program in portable POSIX shell.

## Why

Because GNU stow is written in Perl and I wanted something more portable and
embeddable into my repositories.

## Usage

Most of the behaviour and flags of stow are kept but for a primer type `stow.sh --help`
